imagineer is a CLI frontend for the image [1] and imageproc [2] crates. Imagineer can be used to manipulate images using image operations for static and animated images, and can decode and encode images to a wide variety of formats.

Formats
-------

Decode:
* AVIF, BMP, GIF, DDS, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, OpenExr, PNG, PAM, PBM, PGM, PPM, TGA, TIFF and WebP

Encode:
* AVIF, BMP, Farbfeld, GIF, ICO, JPEG, OpenExr, PNG, PNM (PAM, PBM, PGM and PPM), QOI TGA, TIFF and WebP.

Usage
-----

Basic usage: `ig --input example.png --output converted.avif` (more at: `ig --help`)

Batch processing
----------------

To batch process a collection of images, replace `--input` and `--output` by respectively `--glob-input` and `--glob-output`.
The arguments provided to these options should be a valid glob pattern.
You may need to provide quotation marks around the pattern, so your shell will not superfluously expand it.
The --glob-output argument expects an output folder instead of a file path, and the file structure from the first common folder of
the matching input image paths will be mirrored to the output directory.

A thank you and request
-----------------------

We would like to explicitly state that the imagineer authors are not affiliated with the authors of the image and imageproc crates.
We do want to thank them for developing so many high quality libraries!

If you run into an issue caused by the imagineer program, please report them to us directly by creating an issue (other contributions or friendly feedback is also appreciated):
